    <p>I am currently a Social Media and Digital Strategy Major with a minor in acting. Outside of school I am an actor on the new CW show '4400'. I have always been interested in acting, but I didn't start taking it seriously until I was about 16 years old. I also love to sing and started taking lessons at a music school around the same time I started going on auditions for tv shows.

    <p>In High School. My conservatory was Visual Art in high school. Here are some pieces from my Senior Year Concentration.</p>

            <h3>Ambitions for the Future</h3>
            <p> I intend on continuing my work as an actor by going on auditions and working on various projects. Hopefully the show I currently work on is picked up for a season 2.</p>
