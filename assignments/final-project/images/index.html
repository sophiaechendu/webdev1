        <p id="special-box" class="box">I am currently a Social Media and Digital Strategy Major with a minor in acting. Web Development has taught me a lot about web design. I cannot believe how much goes into building a website. It's tricky, but the process is pretty fun when I can actually figure out what I'm doing, haha.</p>
<div class="box funky-border"> I have always been interested in acting, but I didn't start taking it seriously until I was about 16 years old. I also love to sing and started taking lessons at a music school I found on my way home from school when I was a freshman in High School.</div>
<div class="box absolute funky-border">My conservatory was Visual Art in high school. Here are some pieces from my Senior Year Concentration.</div>
<div class="box relative">Thank you for stopping by! Have a great day :)</div>
