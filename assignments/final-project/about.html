    <p>I am currently a Social Media and Digital Strategy Major with a minor in acting. For the past six months, I have been working on a tv show for the CW. I play the role of Mariah Kaminski, a 16 year old who just wants to do right by those she loves. Acting has always been an interest to me, as well as other areas of art. in high school I was a visual artist with a focus in drawing and painting. My favorite medium to use was Prismacolor colored pencils. I haven't maed too many new pieces, but I hope to focus on my visual art again come 2022.

            <h3>Ambitions for the Future</h3>
            <p> I intend on continuing my work as an actor by going on auditions and working on various projects. Hopefully the show I currently work on is picked up for a season 2. I also intend on graduating from college within the next few years. Chicago is my favorite city to live, so I hope I stay here for quite some time in the near future, but I wouldn't mind if my work as an actor took me to other cities around the world as well. Chicago isn't going anywhere, and I know i'll always be back.</p>
