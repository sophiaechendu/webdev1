        <h3>We all have a comfort show to watch, mine just so happens to be New Girl</h3><p>No matter how my day is going, I can always count on Fox's 'New Girl' to put me in a good mood. I never get bored with the various storylines, the actors have such great chemistry, the writting keeps the audience on their toes, and not to mention, the show is hilarious in the eyes of many. As an actress, it inspires me to try out comedy and work that into my career as a performer.

        <h3>Favorite Character: Winston Schmidt</h3>
        <p>I love all of the characters on the show, but Winston Schmidt, who usually just goes by Winston, has to be my favorite. Max Greenfield's portrayal of the character is unmacthed and he never fails to make me laugh. There are so many funny one liners that Schmidt says throughout every episode that make the show even better./p>
