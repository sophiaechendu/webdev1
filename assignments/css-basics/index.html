        <h3>Finding the product that works for you</h3>
    </section>
        <p>There are so many different hair types and patterns. Not every product someone recommends is going to work for yours. When it comes to hair, we tend to over look its porosity. Once we understand our porosity level, we can find what products work best for us.</p>

        <h3>About Curly Porotisty</h3>
        <p>Curly Porosity is a new hair line that pays attention to your hair needs. If your hair doesn't like to obsorb treatments and water, chances are you have low porosity hair. If your hair obsorbs moisture quickly, you may have high porosity hair. If you are a mix of both, you may fall somehwere in the middle. But don't worry! We have products for all three cases.</p>
